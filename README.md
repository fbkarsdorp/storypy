# StoryPy

This repo consists of a collection of scripts in Python to deal with a small collection of Dutch folktales. This page describes some ongoing research on character interaction patterns in (folktale) narratives.

## Data

As our corpus, we use the booklet *Volkssprookjes uit Nederland en Vlaanderen* (1978), a collection of 78 stories by the collector J.W.R. Sinninghe. Four of these stories were excluded, because they consisted of a collection nursery rhymes, which were unusable for the purposes of the current research. The complete corpus can be found [here](https://github.com/fbkarsdorp/storypy/tree/master/storypy/data/texts).

## Co-reference resolution

All stories in our corpus have been fully annotated for coreferences of both characters and locations. The annotations have been created using the annotation tool [brat](http://brat.nlplab.org/). The following image shows a small example of some annotations made for one of the folktales:

All annotations are available in the directory [data/annotations](https://github.com/fbkarsdorp/storypy/tree/master/storypy/data/annotations).
